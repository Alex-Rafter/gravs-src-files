                            In addition to Renault and Kia, we offer the award-winning Dacia and SEAT ranges in
                            Kidwelly. We currently sell over 2,500 new cars and vans annually, as well as over 5,000
                            used vehicles. We usually stock over 600 used cars across the group.
                            Our development has allowed us to give back to the community in southwest Wales.
                            Currently, we are proud sponsors of the Scarlets as well as numerous local choirs,
                            sporting and charity organisations.
                            We are also immensely proud of our ten year partnership with The Urdd, the Welsh Language
                            Association, who amongst other valuable humanitarian activities, give the young people
                            of Wales the chance to live vibrant lives through the medium of Welsh, learning at the
                            same time to respect each other and people around the world. At Gravells, we operate a
                            bilingual language policy, placing equal emphasis on Welsh and English for your
