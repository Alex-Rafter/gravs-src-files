						<p>We advise you to talk to us before you talk to anyone else, not all finance packages are the
							same and it can be very difficult to make an educated decision. Low rate finance, zero
							percent finance, Hire Purchase, Personal Contract Plans, Contract Hire, the list goes on...
						</p>
						<p>If you're unsure what the difference is between a Hire Purchase agreement and a Personal
							Contract Plan we have made some short videos which are available here for you to watch.</p>
