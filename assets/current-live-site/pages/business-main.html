								<h3>Contract Hire</h3>
								<p>it is a simple contract where the customer pays the rental cost to use the vehicle
									over two, three or four years. Subject to terms and conditions, the customer then
									simply hands their vehicle back at the end of the agreed time period. Quite often
									maintenance packages are also included so there are no unforeseen extra costs and
									our specialist team will then get in contact to ensure an easy change to a new
									vehicle.</p>

								<h3>Hire Purchase</h3>
								<p>This option allows customers to purchase their vehicle without any large upfront
									payments. Our dedicated team will discuss with you the time period, annual mileage
									and the make/model you would like and then a deposit and monthly payment amount are
									agreed. At the end of the term the customer makes their final payment and then owns
									the vehicle. The fixed monthly payments allow for the strict budgeting which is
									needed by businesses and therefore is a great option.</p>

								<h3>Lease Purchase</h3>
								<p>A lease purchase agreement means that the customer owns the vehicle at the end of the
									contract but monthly payments are kept lower by having a balloon payment at the end.
									Once this final payment is made, the customer completely owns their vehicle.</p>
